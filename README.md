<br />  

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- Anaconda
- Python extension for VS Code

Refer to [this tutorial - data science on VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial) to set up your environment and test out ipython (Jupyter Notebook).

<br />  

## Setup Virtual Environment and Install Python packages

1. Create Your Virtual Environment  

    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv env
    ```

2. Launch your virtual environment  

    A. **In VSCode**  
    Run Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal (⌃⇧`)) from the Command Palette, which creates a terminal and automatically activates the virtual environment by running its activation script.  

    or B. **run in command line**

    ```bash
    $ source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install Packages (from a prepackaged list of programs)

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

<br />  

## Juypter Notebook

You will be able to start creating Juypter Notebook in VSCode environment, as long as you create new file with extension **.ipynb**.

<br />

## Running Main Dash App

1. To run the Main App, run the following line.

    ```bash
    $ python index.py
    ```

<br />  

## Running Dash App for indivdual lab

1. To run dash app for each lab, run the following line.

    ```bash
    # lab 1
    $ python lab1app.py  
    # lab 2
    $ python lab2app.py  
    # lab 3
    $ python lab3app.py  
    ```

2. Open browser in your local machine and navigate http://localhost:8050

<br />  

## Running Dockerize Dash App via Docker Compose

- (Note: only root app app.py will be able to run from docker.)  

- Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose in your target system.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Start using git and GitHub

To get started with our repo

```bash
$ git config — global user.name “your_handle”
$ git config — global user.email “your@email.com”
$ git clone https://github.com/todatech/csda-lab.git
```

<br />  

## Notes For Reference

### Conda

To install packages (i.e. nltk, scikit, etc) in your anaconda environment  

```bash
$ conda activate base  
$ conda install -c anaconda nltk  
$ conda install -c conda-forge scikit-surprise  
# install whatever packages needed.
```
